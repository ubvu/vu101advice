### Products & services

We provide researchers with ready-to-analyze data and the hardware needed for the analysis. We make sure that methods, techniques or code used in analysis are available for reuse by others. We provide training in research data and digital scholarship.

* provide bespoke data
    * We consult with the researcher to make sure we have a thorough understanding of the research question(s). We then provide the necessary data from online resources. Data are cleaned and consistent.
* access to hardware
    * We provide access to hardware for analysis, when a standard computer is no longer suitable, e.g. when it is too slow or the screens are too small.  We either act as intermediary between the researchers and e.g. HPC-centres or we provide hardware in the library.
* archive of methods, techniques, code
    * We maintain a repository for descriptions of methods and techniques or code, so that these remain available. We either maintain this repository ourselves or collaborate with other institutions.
* training in data structures
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on different data structures. After completing the training, researchers know what different structures there are (e.g. tabular data, Linked Open Data as RDF) and for what purposes these are most suited. They are able to make an informed decision on which data structure to use. They are able to structure their data in the chosen structure, using international standards where possible.  We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help in structuring their data.
* training in cleaning data
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on cleaning data. After completing the training, researchers know why it is important to clean their data. They know what tools are available (e.g. OpenRefine) and can make an informed decision on which tool to use. They are able to clean their data. We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help in cleaning their data.
* training in Digital Scholarship methods
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on different methods in Digital Scholarship, e.g. text mining. After completing the training, researchers know what methods are suited for their research question. They know what tools are available and can make an informed decision on which tool to use. They have a basic understanding of how to use the tool(s).  We organize 'meet-an-expert-caf√©'s', where researchers with questions on methods or tools can get help from more experienced researchers.
