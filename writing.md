### Products & services

We help researchers in focusing on the content of their writing. We do this by providing training in tools that take care of other aspects of writing (version control, formatting, reference management). We also provide a place where they can get away from other busy-work.

* distraction-free writing environment
    * We provide researchers with a distraction-free room, that is especially designated for writing. There is no internet available and there are no other distractions allowed, such as conversations with others or phone calls. We provide a schedule, for example pomodoro-style (25 minutes of focused work, 5 minute break)
* provide template documents for specific journal / publisher
    * We provide researchers with a template document for the journal or publisher chosen. The template document contains all requirements (for structure or styling) of the journal / publisher.
* training in collaborative writing
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on collaborative writing. After completing the training, researchers know what tools are available  and can make an informed decision on which tool to use. They know how to use the tool of their choosing and know what additional rules they need to set with their collaborators for an efficient writing process. We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help.
* training in "content first" writing (plain text, Markdown)
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on "content first" writing. After completing the training, researchers know what the benefits are of using tools that more rigidly separate writing from styling. They know what tools are available  and can make an informed decision on which tool to use. They know how to use the tool of their choosing. We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help.
* training in using reference managers
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on using reference managers. After completing the training, researchers know what the benefits are of using reference management software. They are able to make an informed decision on which tool(s) to use. They are able to add references from the search engines or bibliographic databases they use, organize these and annotate them. They are able to add references to their documents (in Word or other writing software). We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help.
