## Value map

### Products & services

* perform literature / data / project / researcher search
    * We consult with the researcher to make sure we have a thorough understanding of the research question(s). We then perform the search in all relevant databases and provide the researchers with a complete list of relevant material in a reference management file.
* perform network analysis of researchers
    * We consult with the researcher to make sure we have a thorough understanding of the researcher's needs. We then perform a network analysis, e.g. of his own group or of a potential research partner, based on publications or existing partners. We provide the researcher with a report of this analysis, with visualizations when necessary.
* build a search results alert
    * We consult with a researcher to make sure we have a thorough understanding of the research question. We then build a search query and the alert.
* provide a tool (browser button / add-on) that gives direct access to (licensed) publications
    * We give researchers a tool they can use in their browser, that detects bibliographic information on any page they are visiting. With one click the researcher gets access to the licensed material.
* provide a tool (browser button / add-on) that gives direct information on author of specific paper
    *  We give researchers a tool they can use in their browser, that detects bibliographic information on any page they are visiting. With one click the researcher can get background information on the authors found on the page, based on academic profiles or metrics.
* provide a system to maintain a search profile, performing automated searches
    * We give researchers a tool that they can use to build a search profile for different search engines or bibliographic databases. The profile can be pre-filled based on information from the researcher's publications (or e.g. course material). The researcher can make changes to the profile if needed. The researcher can either use the profile when needed or have alerts delivered to them (as email, rss feed, twitter dm etc.)
* provide a tool (browser button / add-on) that gives a 'must-read-measure' (based on searcher's profile, metrics of author(s), article)
    * We give researchers a tool that they can use in their browser, that detects bibliographic information on any page they are visiting. It then calculates a 'must-read-measure', that gives a measure of how necessary it is for a researcher to read the publications in question, given their research interests. The tool uses information from e.g. the researcher's publications to determine their research interests. It calculates the 'must-read-measure' based on e.g. the similarity between the research interests and the publications, or the metrics of the publications or their authors.
* provide training on using alerts
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on using alerts. After completing the training, researchers know why it can be helpful to receive automated alerts and they are able to create alerts in the search engine or bibliographic database they use. We have a helpdesk that researchers can contact (online or face-to-face) when they need help in creating or maintaining alerts.
* training in using reference managers
    * We provide a training, both online and face-to-face, on using reference managers. After completing the training, researchers know what the benefits are of using reference management software. They are able to make an informed decision on which tool(s) to use. They are able to add references from the search engines or bibliographic databases they use, organize these and annotate them.
